This DAG can takes three consecutive numbers before any character and creates an directed edge with them.
You can use Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm to find max flow between points, using g.maxFlow().
You can find the shortest path between points using g.getPath(Vertex 1,Vertex 2).
And how many vertices with g.size();

We were working on Kruskal, Prim and dijkstra algos
