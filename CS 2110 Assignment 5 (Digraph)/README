This DAG can takes three consecutive numbers before any character and creates an directed edge with them.
You can use Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm to find max flow between points, using g.maxFlow().
You can find the shortest path between points using g.getPath(Vertex 1,Vertex 2).
You can find the MinSpanTree using Kruskal algo, using g.kruskal().edges().
And how many vertices with g.size();

We were working on Kruskal, Prim and dijkstra algos
